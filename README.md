# Northcoders Group Project - Part-Time Pet

## Summary

Borrow a bear; lend a llama. A pet sharing app for mobile devices.

Part-Time Pet is the final project of my time at the Northcoders Bootcamp. Created alongside 4 other people within two weeks, the app aims to make pets accessible to everyone with the ability to lend out/loan pets to people local to you via our queried search and real-time messaging features.

In addition to this front end a middleware API was also created which can be [found here](https://github.com/IanFindlay/nc-project-api).

## Front End Tech-Stack

- Flutter - Uses the Dart programming language and compiles to native Android/iOS code

- Firebase - Used directly for image storage, authentication and real-time messaging (used more comprehensively in the middleware linked above)

## Features

- Register a new account
- Find available pets via queries (distance from you, species) or search for keywords
- Contact other users using real-time messaging and access all of your previous conversations
- Add/Delete reviews that appear on people's profile pages
- Add pets that you are willing to lend to your own profile page with the ability to edit their information or delete it entirely

## Video Demonstration

The infrastructure behind the project is not currently designed to be publicly accessible and may not always be hosted and/or maintained so the best way to see an example of Part-Time Pet in action is via the video on the [Northcoders website](https://northcoders.com/projects/april-2022/part-time-pet).
